# Java
* The Java Virtual Machine(JVM) is the platform on which java operates. The JVM infrastructure may take time to get used to, but the classpath and packaging concepts are tries and true. Some major benefits of JVM are how stable of a platform it is, tons of high-quality libraries, and the Just-In-Time compiler gives you performance which rivals native code.

# C#
* Dynamic type is one of the unique thing in C#. This is highly unusual for a strong statically-typed OO language. The dynamic type essentially tells the compiler not to bother trying to statically resolve any member calls or other behavior of a variable of the type, instead digesting these to reflective invocation for work against a type whose specifics are not known until runtime.
* While most OO languages/frameworks have good support for the asynchronous model, these async/await keywords set C# apart, by essentially encapsulating the Task Parallel Library into the language, much as "yield return" made implementing an IEnumerable that much easier. "Async" decorates a method that contains at least one asynchronous call. "Await" decorates the call itself.
