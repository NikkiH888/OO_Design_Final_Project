# Java
* Interfaces are a list of methods definitions which a class must implement. The interfaces only contain the function prototype, it is up to the classes to write the body of the code. If a class implements an interface it must contain all those methods listen in the interface or else it will fail to compile. Unlike C#, Java allows you to declare variables in interfaces.

# C#
* Interfaces in C# are very similar to Java because they cannot be instantiated, and they don't contain the implementation of any methods. Interfaces in C# contain properties events, indexers, etc. C# interfaces cannot contain constant fields like Java but they can contain properties.
