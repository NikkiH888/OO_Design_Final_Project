# OO_Design_Final_Project
This final project is to pick two object-oriented languages and compare.

### Comparison Criteria are as follows: 

#### Language purpose/genesis
```sh
Why was the language created?
What problems was the language trying to address?
Is the language a reaction to a previous language or a replacement for another language?
```

#### Unique features of the language
```sh
Does the language have any particularly unique features?
```
 
#### Name spaces
```sh
How are name spaces implemented?
How are name spaces used?
```

#### Types
```sh	
What types does the language support?
Are both reference and value types supported?
Can new value types be created?
``` 

#### Classes
```sh
Defining
Creating new instances
Constructing/initializing
Destructing/de-initializing
```

#### Instance reference name in data type (class)
```sh
this? self?
```

#### Properties
```sh
Getters and settersâ€¦write your own or built in?
Backing variables?
Computed properties?
```
  
#### Interfaces / protocols
```sh
What does the language support?
What abilities does it have?
How is it used?
```

#### Inheritance / extension

#### Reflection
```sh
What reflection abilities are supported?
How is reflection used?
```

#### Memory management
```sh
How is it handled?
How does it work?
Garbage collection?
Automatic reference counting?
```

#### Comparisons of references and values
```sh
How are values compared? (i.e. comparing two strings)
```

#### Null/nil references
```sh
Which does the language use? (null/nil/etc)
Does the language have features for handling null/nil references?
```

#### Errors and exception handling

#### Lambda expressions, closures, or functions as types

#### Implementation of listeners and event handlers

#### Singleton
```sh
How is a singleton implemented?
Can it be made thread-safe?
Can the singleton instance be lazily instantiated?
```
#### Procedural programming
```sh
Does the language support procedural programming?
```

#### Functional programming
```sh
Does the language support functional programming?
```

#### Multithreading
```sh
Threads or thread-like abilities
How is multitasking accomplished?
```
