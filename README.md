# OO_Design_Final_Project
This final project is to pick two object-oriented languages and compare.

# Comparison Criteria are as follows: 
```sh
•	Language purpose/genesis
  o	Why was the language created?
  o	What problems was the language trying to address?
  o	Is the language a reaction to a previous language or a replacement for another language?
•	Unique features of the language
  o	Does the language have any particularly unique features?
•	Name spaces
  o	How are name spaces implemented?
  o	How are name spaces used?
•	Types
  o	What types does the language support?
  o	Are both reference and value types supported?
  o	Can new value types be created?
•	Classes
  o	Defining
  o	Creating new instances
  o	Constructing/initializing
  o	Destructing/de-initializing
•	Instance reference name in data type (class)
  o	this? self?
•	Properties
  o	Getters and setters…write your own or built in?
  o	Backing variables?
  o	Computed properties?
•	Interfaces / protocols
  o	What does the language support?
  o	What abilities does it have?
  o	How is it used?
•	Inheritance / extension
•	Reflection
  o	What reflection abilities are supported?
  o	How is reflection used?
•	Memory management
  o	How is it handled?
  o	How does it work?
  o	Garbage collection?
  o	Automatic reference counting?
•	Comparisons of references and values
  o	How are values compared? (i.e. comparing two strings)
•	Null/nil references
  o	Which does the language use? (null/nil/etc)
  o	Does the language have features for handling null/nil references?
•	Errors and exception handling
•	Lambda expressions, closures, or functions as types
•	Implementation of listeners and event handlers
•	Singleton
  o	How is a singleton implemented?
  o	Can it be made thread-safe?
  o	Can the singleton instance be lazily instantiated?
•	Procedural programming
  o	Does the language support procedural programming?
•	Functional programming
  o	Does the language support functional programming?
•	Multithreading
  o	Threads or thread-like abilities
  o	How is multitasking accomplished?
