# Java
* The EventHandler class provides support for dynamically generating event listeners whose methods execute a simple statement involving an incoming event object and a target object. The EventHandler class is intended to be used by interactive tools, such as application builders.

# C#
* An event in C# is a way for a class to provide notifications to clients of that class when some interesting thing happens to an object. The most familiar use for events is in graphical user interfaces. The classes that represent controls in the interface have events that are notified when the user does something to the control such as clicking a button.
* Events need to be used only for graphical interfaces, it provide a generally useful way for objects to signal state changes that may be useful to clients of that object. And they are also an important building block for creating classes, which can be reused in a number of different programs.
