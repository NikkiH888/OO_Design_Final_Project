At the internet time, the first web browsers were being released, and Java was the very frist for embedding into the browsers. James Gosling created Java in June 1991. He wanted to use a syntax that would be familiar to C or C++ users, and there were primary goals that Java set out as following:
  - Robust and Secure
  - High Performance and Highly Robust Applications on Multiple Platforms in Heterogeneous 
  - Simple, Object-oriented, and Familiar
  - Architecture-neutral and Portable
  - Interpreted, Threaded, and Dynamic
  - Distributed Networks
```
