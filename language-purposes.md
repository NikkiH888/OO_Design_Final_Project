# Java

At the internet time, the first web browsers were being released, and Java was the very frist for
embedding into the browsers. James Gosling created Java in June 1991. He wanted to use a syntax 
that would be familiar to C or C++ users, and there were primary goals that Java tries to enanble 
as following:
 1. Robust and Secure
 2. High Performance and Highly Robust Applications on Multiple Platforms in Heterogeneous 
 3. Simple, Object-oriented, and Familiar
 4. Architecture-neutral and Portable
 5. Interpreted, Threaded, and Dynamic
 6. Distributed Networks

# C#

Anders Hejlsberg was a lead architech of Microsoft that developing C#. During that time he thought 
that there were flaws in most major programming languages (i.e. C++, Java, Delphi, Smalltalk, etc.)
which drove the development of C#. Other purpose of creating it was needing to port the .NET framework 
and other libraries. The two languages are similar, but they began to take seperate paths after 2005.
