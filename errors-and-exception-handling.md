# Java 
* Exceptions: a user has entered invalid data, a file has been requested but can not be found, network connection has been lost in the middle of processing or JVM has run out of memory. 
* The 'throws' statement is used in java to throw an exception. 
* Recovering from Error is not possible, so the only solution to errors is to terminate the execution. Whereas you can recover from Exception by using either try-catch blocks or throwing exception back to caller.


# C#
* Exceptions: problem that arises during the execution of a program. 
#### C# Exception handling is built upon four keywords:
* Try: A try block identifies a block of code for which particular exceptions is activated. It is followed by one or more catch blocks.
* Catch: A program catches an exception with an exception handler at the place in a program where you want to handle the problem. The catch keyword indicates the catching of an exception.
* Finally: The finally block is used to execute a given set of statements, whether an exception is thrown or not thrown. For example, if you open a file, it must be closed whether an exception is raised or not.
* Throw: A program throws an exception when a problem shows up. This is done using a throw keyword.
